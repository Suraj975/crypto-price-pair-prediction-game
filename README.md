## How we built it
The first thing was to write a contract which will capture the user details, and user rounds, and calculate rewards. This contract was built on solidity and deployed on the polygon test net for lower transaction fees.

To create a Web UI for the user to perform actions as per the game rules. For this, React was used to built the UI and metamask for blockchain transactions.
